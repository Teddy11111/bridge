Initial plans where to use node-pty + xterm but apperently its huge pain in the ass
to build node-pty since it requires some c++ tools. At this moment I will leave it for later 
implementation. Consol is not comming right away.

So for first stage of development I need:
1. Make init work
2. Use only spawn process
3. Make git work


For the second stage:
1. Add package installation
2. Add code excecution with API


For the third and last stage:
1. Add terminal
2. Make use of the terminal


Init app WINDOWS
1. Check access to admin privileges
2. Install chocolatey
3. Install git
4. Install git cli
5. Need to solve "gh auth login" issue
    Authentikate with a auth token
6. Download a repo if exists

Init app Unix
1. Check access to admin privileges(optional)
2. Install Brew
3. Install git
4. Install git cli
5. Need to solve "gh auth login" issue
    Authentikate with a auth token
6. Download a repo if exists


remote API:

1. Fast API for implemetation
2. get login/password
3. Returns user congig.

User config:
1. login
2. password
3. git auth tocken go cli gihub
4. remotes for work
5. Needed package config
